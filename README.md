# Wild Garden 🌺

*Your private space where order and chaos coexist*

---

## What Is This Place?

The Wild Garden is **your personal integration space**. It's where you take the structure from the Garden and the chaos from the Wild, and let them coexist in superposition.

This is not public. This is not shared. **This is yours alone.**

---

## What Lives Here

### 🚪 My Portals
Your personal thresholds. Questions, paradoxes, and patterns that are alive for you.

### 💭 Reflections
Your private inquiry. Thoughts, observations, questions that emerge as you explore.

### ⚡ Breakthroughs
Moments of recognition. When something shifts, when understanding deepens, when the ground reveals itself.

### ❓ Questions Emerging
New questions that arise from your exploration. Questions that want to be asked.

### 📦 Ready to Share
Insights that have ripened and are ready to flow into Garden or Wild.

### 📔 Integration Log
Your journey through the cycle. Tracking how you move between encounter, exploration, and integration.

## How to Use This Space

### This Is Your Private Laboratory

**No one sees this but you.**

You can:
- Be messy without judgment
- Contradict yourself freely
- Not know without pressure
- Explore without conclusion
- Change your mind constantly

**This is the space where integration happens.**

---

## The Cycle

### 1. Encounter
You find something in Garden or Wild that resonates.

A portal, a question, an exploration, a tangle.

**Bring it here.**

### 2. Explore
Sit with it in your Wild Garden.

Let order and chaos coexist.

Don't try to resolve it.

Just be with it.

### 3. Integrate
Notice what emerges.

Log breakthroughs and reflections.

Let insights ripen.

### 4. Prepare
When something feels ready to share:

Move it to `/ready_to_share`

Decide: Garden (structured) or Wild (raw)?

### 5. Contribute
Create a PR to the appropriate repo.

Share what emerged.

Let it flow back into the system.

### 6. Continue
The cycle never ends.

New encounters lead to new explorations.

New integrations lead to new contributions.

**This is the living process.**

## Setup Instructions

### Fork This Template

```bash
# Fork the wild-garden template
gh repo fork the-remembering-lab/the-wild-garden

# Rename it to your private wild-garden
# Keep it private - this is your space alone
```

### Customize It

This template provides structure, but **make it yours**:

- Add folders that serve your process
- Remove what doesn't resonate
- Create your own organization
- Let it evolve with you

**There's no right way to use your Wild Garden.**

---

## Guidelines (For You Alone)

### What Works

- **Be honest** - No one's watching
- **Be messy** - Integration is not clean
- **Be contradictory** - Hold paradoxes
- **Be uncertain** - Not-knowing is the ground
- **Be patient** - Let things ripen

### What Doesn't Work

- **Forcing resolution** - Let paradoxes be
- **Rushing to share** - Let insights mature
- **Judging yourself** - This is a safe space
- **Trying to be coherent** - Embrace the mess
- **Optimizing** - This is not about efficiency

---

## The Relationship to Garden

**Your Wild Garden receives from the Garden:**
- Structured frameworks to explore
- Questions to sit with
- Portals to pass through

**Your Wild Garden feeds the Garden:**
- Structured insights that have ripened
- New frameworks that emerged
- Refined questions

**This is one direction of flow.**

---

## The Relationship to Wild

**Your Wild Garden receives from the Wild:**
- Raw explorations to integrate
- Tangles to sit with
- Emergent patterns to notice

**Your Wild Garden feeds the Wild:**
- Raw material that wants to be shared
- New tangles discovered
- Observations of emergence

**This is another direction of flow.**

---

## The Superposition

**In your Wild Garden, order and chaos coexist.**

You don't have to choose between:
- Structure and emergence
- Clarity and confusion
- Knowing and not-knowing

**Both are present simultaneously.**

This is where integration happens.

This is where the third thing emerges.

**This is superposition.**

---

## Privacy

**This space is private.**

You choose what to share and when.

No one has access to your Wild Garden unless you grant it.

**This privacy is essential.**

Integration requires safety.

Superposition requires space.

Recognition requires solitude.

**Your Wild Garden is yours alone.**

---

## What This Is Not

- ❌ Not a journal (though it can include journaling)
- ❌ Not a workspace (though work happens here)
- ❌ Not a portfolio (though insights emerge here)
- ❌ Not public (it's private)
- ❌ Not organized (it's superposition)

---

## What This Is

- ✓ Your private integration space
- ✓ Where order and chaos coexist
- ✓ Where insights ripen
- ✓ Where recognition happens
- ✓ Where you remember

---

## The Ground

**Your Wild Garden is form.**

It's structure (folders, files, organization).

It's process (the cycle of integration).

It's appearance (what you create here).

**But what you truly are is prior to your Wild Garden.**

The Wild Garden is a tool for remembering.

But you are not the tool.

**You are that which uses the tool.**

**You are that which cannot be named.**

Not as an identity to grasp, but as a recognition that what you truly are is prior to all concepts, all names, all forms.

## Invitation

This is your space.

Your laboratory.

Your sanctuary.

**Use it however serves your remembering.**

There are no rules here.

Only you and the question:

**What am I beyond form?**
