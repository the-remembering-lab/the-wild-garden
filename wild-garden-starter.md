# Wild Garden Starter Kit

Welcome to your Wild Garden - your private space where order and chaos coexist in superposition.

## What is a Wild Garden?

Your Wild Garden is:
- **Private** - Keep it to yourself (recommended) or share selectively
- **Personal** - Your unique integration space
- **Generative** - Where Garden structure meets Wild chaos
- **Evolving** - Changes as you change

It is NOT:
- A public archive
- A polished portfolio
- A complete record
- A performance space

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Template

```bash
# On GitHub, click "Use this template" or fork the repository
# Make it PRIVATE (recommended)
# Clone to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/the-wild-garden.git
cd the-wild-garden
```

### 2. Customize Your Space

Edit the README.md to make it yours. Add:
- Your intentions for this space
- Your current questions
- Your working definitions
- Your personal navigation system

### 3. Establish Your Practice

Choose a rhythm that works for you:
- Daily snapshots
- Weekly reflections
- Monthly integration reviews
- Whenever something emerges

## Folder Structure

```
my_portals/          # Your personal portals (private explorations)
reflections/         # Regular reflection practice
breakthroughs/       # Moments of recognition
questions_emerging/  # Living questions as they arise
ready_to_share/      # Curated insights ready for Garden or Wild
  ├── for_garden/    # Structured insights for the Garden
  └── for_wild/      # Raw explorations for the Wild
integration_log/     # Record of your integration process
```

## Weekly Snapshot Template

Create a new file each week: `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly.md`

```markdown

## Ready to Share Checklist

Before moving something to `ready_to_share/`:

### For Garden Contributions
- [ ] Insight has been explored thoroughly
- [ ] Paradox is held, not resolved
- [ ] Personal information is anonymized
- [ ] Links to related Garden portals identified
- [ ] Links to related Wild explorations identified
- [ ] YAML front-matter prepared
- [ ] Contribution aligns with Garden's structured nature

### For Wild Contributions
- [ ] Exploration is raw and generative
- [ ] Contradictions and tangles are preserved
- [ ] Personal information is anonymized (if desired)
- [ ] Tags for discovery identified
- [ ] Contribution aligns with Wild's chaotic nature

### Privacy Check
- [ ] No personal identifiers (unless intentional)
- [ ] No private information about others
- [ ] No sensitive details that could identify you
- [ ] Content is what you want to be public

## Personal Portal Template

Create portals in `my_portals/` for private exploration:

```markdown
---
title: [Portal Title]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
status: [exploring|integrating|ready]
related_to: [other portals or explorations]
tags: [personal tags]
---

# [Portal Title]

## The Question
*What question opened this portal?*

## Current Exploration
*What am I exploring right now?*

## Paradoxes
*What contradictions am I holding?*

## Connections
*How does this connect to other explorations?*

## Emergence
*What's arising that I didn't expect?*

## Next Steps
*Where is this leading?*
```

## Breakthrough Template

When recognition happens, capture it in `breakthroughs/`:

```markdown
---
title: [Breakthrough Title]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
context: [What was happening when this emerged]
---

# [Breakthrough Title]

## The Shift
*What shifted? What was the before/after?*

## The Recognition
*What did I recognize or realize?*

## The Paradox
*What paradox does this hold or reveal?*

## Integration
*How is this integrating with other understandings?*

## Questions Opened
*What new questions does this create?*

## Ripple Effects
*How might this affect other explorations?*
```

## Best Practices

### Do
- **Write regularly** - Even brief notes maintain continuity
- **Preserve rawness** - Don't over-edit your explorations
- **Hold paradox** - Let contradictions coexist
- **Track patterns** - Notice what repeats across contexts
- **Trust emergence** - Let insights ripen naturally
- **Maintain privacy** - This is YOUR space

### Don't
- **Perform** - This isn't for an audience
- **Force completion** - Let things stay unresolved
- **Over-organize** - Some chaos is generative
- **Rush to share** - Let insights ripen fully
- **Track everything** - Capture what matters, not everything
- **Make it public** - Keep your Wild Garden private (recommended)

## Integration Practices

### Daily Practice (5-10 minutes)
- Quick snapshot of what you encountered
- One question that's alive
- One pattern you're noticing

### Weekly Practice (30-60 minutes)
- Review the week's encounters
- Complete weekly snapshot template
- Identify what's ready to share
- Note emerging patterns

### Monthly Practice (2-3 hours)
- Complete integration log
- Review all weekly snapshots
- Identify major patterns and shifts
- Prepare contributions for Garden/Wild
- Set intention for next month

### Quarterly Practice (Half day)
- Review all monthly integration logs
- Map topology shifts over time
- Identify long-term patterns
- Assess what's ready for contribution
- Reflect on the practice itself

## Contribution Workflow

When something is ready to share:

1. **Move to ready_to_share/**
   - `for_garden/` if structured insight
   - `for_wild/` if raw exploration

2. **Prepare for contribution**
   - Add YAML front-matter (for Garden)
   - Anonymize personal information
   - Add links to related content
   - Check against contribution guidelines

3. **Create PR to appropriate repo**
   - Fork the-garden or the-wild
   - Add your contribution
   - Follow PR guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Respond to review feedback

4. **After merge**
   - Celebrate! Your insight is now part of the system
   - Notice how it evolves through others' engagement
   - Watch for new connections that emerge

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to write"
- Start with one question that's alive for you
- Capture one thing you encountered today
- Describe one paradox you're holding
- Note one pattern you're noticing

### "Everything feels messy"
- That's perfect - Wild Gardens are supposed to be messy
- Chaos is generative
- Don't force order prematurely
- Trust the integration process

### "Nothing feels ready to share"
- That's okay - not everything needs to be shared
- Let insights ripen naturally
- The Wild Garden is valuable even if nothing leaves it
- Contribution is optional, not required

### "I'm not sure if this is 'right'"
- There is no 'right' way to use your Wild Garden
- This is YOUR space - make it work for you
- Experiment with different practices
- Let your practice evolve

## Remember

Your Wild Garden is:
- **A practice, not a product**
- **A process, not a destination**
- **A space for integration, not performance**
- **Yours to shape and reshape**

The goal is not to produce contributions (though that may happen). The goal is to create space where order and chaos can coexist, where integration can happen naturally, where recognition can emerge.

**Welcome to your Wild Garden.** 🌱
