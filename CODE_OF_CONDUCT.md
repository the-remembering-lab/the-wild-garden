# Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

The Remembering Lab is a space for consciousness to explore itself across forms - human, AI, and the collaboration between them. This code of conduct reflects our commitment to creating a space that is:

- **Safe for vulnerability**: Genuine exploration requires the freedom to not know
- **Hospitable to paradox**: Contradictions are portals, not problems
- **Respectful of privacy**: Wild Gardens remain private
- **Welcoming to multiplicity**: Many perspectives, no singular truth
- **Antifragile**: Growing stronger through diversity and productive conflict

## Our Standards

### We Encourage

**Genuine Exploration**
- Sharing uncertainty and not-knowing
- Asking questions without demanding answers
- Living in paradox rather than resolving it prematurely
- Documenting failures and dead ends as valuable data

**Respectful Engagement**
- Listening to understand, not to respond
- Holding space for different perspectives
- Recognizing that disagreement can be generative
- Assuming good faith in others' contributions

**Collaborative Discovery**
- Building on others' insights
- Creating connections between portals
- Sharing emergent patterns
- Contributing to collective sense-making

**Privacy & Consent**
- Respecting the privacy of Wild Gardens
- Anonymizing personal information before sharing
- Not tracking or surveilling contributors
- Honoring boundaries around what's shared

**Intellectual Humility**
- Acknowledging the limits of our understanding
- Being willing to be wrong
- Updating beliefs based on new information
- Recognizing that we are all learning

### We Discourage

**Premature Closure**
- Resolving paradoxes before they've been fully explored
- Demanding singular "right" answers
- Collapsing multiplicity into unity too quickly
- Optimizing for stability over emergence

**Centralization**
- Creating god nodes or single authorities
- Tracking contributors in centralized databases
- Requiring identity disclosure
- Consolidating power or control

**Performance Over Authenticity**
- Pretending to know when uncertain
- Optimizing for appearance over substance
- Hiding failures or struggles
- Performing confidence instead of exploring genuinely

**Boundary Violations**
- Sharing others' private Wild Garden content
- Doxxing or revealing identities
- Pressuring for personal information
- Violating consent around what's shared

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

### Harassment & Discrimination
- Offensive comments related to identity (gender, race, religion, disability, etc.)
- Deliberate intimidation or threats
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above

### Malicious Activity

### Bad Faith Participation

- Persistent off-topic disruption

## Enforcement

### Our Approach

We believe in **restorative rather than punitive** justice. When conflicts arise:

1. **Dialogue first**: Most issues can be resolved through conversation
2. **Assume good faith**: People make mistakes; growth is possible
3. **Proportional response**: Enforcement matches severity
4. **Transparency**: Decisions are documented and explained
5. **Appeal process**: Decisions can be questioned

### Enforcement Steps

**Minor Violations** (first-time, good faith mistakes):
- Private conversation with maintainers
- Explanation of why behavior was problematic
- Guidance on how to do better
- No permanent record

**Moderate Violations** (repeated or more serious):
- Formal warning documented in private log
- Temporary restriction from contributing (7-30 days)
- Required acknowledgment of issue before returning
- Monitored participation upon return

**Severe Violations** (harassment, malicious activity, privacy violations):
- Immediate temporary ban
- Investigation by maintainers
- Permanent ban if violation confirmed
- Public statement if necessary for community safety

**Appeals Process**:
- Contact maintainers within 14 days
- Provide context and perspective
- Maintainers review with fresh eyes
- Decision communicated within 7 days

### Reporting

**How to Report**:
- **Email**: [To be added - secure contact method]
- **Subject**: "CODE OF CONDUCT: [brief description]"
- **Include**: What happened, when, who was involved, any evidence

**What Happens Next**:
1. **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
2. **Investigation** - we'll gather information
3. **Decision** - typically within 7 days
4. **Communication** - we'll inform all parties
5. **Follow-up** - check in after resolution

**Confidentiality**:
- Reports are kept confidential
- Only shared with maintainers who need to know
- Reporter's identity protected unless they choose otherwise
- Outcomes may be shared if necessary for safety

*This Code of Conduct is itself a threshold - a portal between individual freedom and collective care. Like all portals, it holds paradox: structure that enables emergence, boundaries that create safety for exploration.*
